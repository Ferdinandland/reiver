# Usage

*For a working implementation, please have a look at the Sample Project - sample*

1. Include the library as local library project.

    ``` compile 'com.yalantis:ucrop:1.0.0' ```
    
2. Add UCropActivity into your AndroidManifest.xml

    ```
    <activity
        android:name="com.yalantis.ucrop.UCropActivity"
        android:screenOrientation="portrait"/>
    ```

3. The uCrop configuration is created using the builder pattern.

	```java
    UCrop.of(sourceUri, destinationUri)
        .withAspectRatio(16, 9)
        .withMaxResultSize(maxWidth, maxHeight)
        .start(context);
    ```


4. Override `onActivityResult` method and handle uCrop result.

    ```java
    @Override
    public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK && requestCode == UCrop.REQUEST_CROP) {
            final Uri resultUri = UCrop.getOutput(data);
        } else if (resultCode == UCrop.RESULT_ERROR) {
            final Throwable cropError = UCrop.getError(data);
        }
    }
    ```


# Customization

If you want to let your users choose crop ratio dynamically, just do not call `withAspectRatio(x, y)`.

uCrop builder class has method `withOptions(UCrop.Options option)` which extends library configurations.

Currently you can change:

   * image compression format (e.g. PNG, JPEG, WEBP), compression
   * image compression quality [0 - 100]. PNG which is lossless, will ignore the quality setting.
   * whether all gestures are enabled simultaneously
   * maximum size for Bitmap that is decoded from source Uri and used within crop view. If you want to override default behaviour.
   * more coming... (e.g. color pallet)
